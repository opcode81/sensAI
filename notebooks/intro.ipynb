    "## VectorModels\n",
    "\n",
    "The central base class for supervised learning problems in sensAI is `VectorModel`. A VectorModel is any model which operates on data points that can be reprsented as vectors of data. Here, vector is to be understood not in the mathematical sense but in the computer science sense, where a vector is simply an array of (potentially arbitaririly complex) data. (The mathematical equivalent is a tuple.) Models are typically expected to be able to process more than one data point at a time and thus should be able to process a sequence of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use pandas DataFrames to represent such sequences of data points. Note that pandas DataFrames are not limited to primitive data types but can hold arbitrary objects in every cell. When dealing with a large number of inputs, DataFrames also provide at least limited meta-information in the form of column names, so we do not lose track of what is contained in which element of a data point (vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "VectorModel itself is an abstract base class, which provides a lot of useful functionality that all its specialisations inherit (as we will see later, particularly in the more advanced tutorials). The class is specialised in `VectorClassificationModel` and `VectorRegressionModel`, which in turn are specialised for various machine learning frameworks (such as sklearn and PyTorch) or can be directly subclassed to create your own model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be dealing with a classification problem. Therefore, we will apply subclasses of `VectorClassificationModel` such as `SkLearnRandomForestVectorClassificationModel`. As an sklearn classification model which uses a well-defined training and inference interface, the implementation of the class is essentially justa few lines of code (given the intermediate abstraction `AbstractSkLearnVectorClassificationModel` for all classification models that use the sklearn protocol)."

    "## Feature Generators and Data Frame Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with the preparation of input data for a model, we often need to cater to technical requirements of various types of models. sensAI seeks to make the process of supporting multiple input pipelines for different types of models as simple as possible - by focusing on concise, declarative semantics and integrating the model-specific data extraction and transformation mechanisms into the models themselves.\n",
    "In essence, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Starting with the raw or most general representation of the data**\n",
    " \n",
    "     This could mean simply starting with the data that is straightforward for us to obtain - or using directly using particular domain specific objects.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     For example, if the problem is to classify situations, we might already have a ``Situation`` class in our code which represents all the data that is is relevant to a situation (e.g. the point in time, the affected user, the location, etc.). Pandas DataFrames can represent arbitrary data, so there is no reason to not simply use as the raw input data frame that is fed to our models a single column containing instances of class ``Situation``.\n",
    "     Or we might instead directly observe a set of sensor readings, all of which are real numbers; this scenario would certainly be closer to what we typically see in machine learning data sets, but it isn't always the case in the real world.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Whatever the case may be, we can represent it in a data frame. We call the original input data frame, which we pass to a sensAI ``VectorModel``, the *raw data frame*.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Extracing features from the raw data, using their \"natural\" representation** (using ``FeatureGenerators``)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     We extract from the raw data frame pieces of information that we regard as relevant *features* for the task at hand.\n",
    "     A sensAI ``FeatureGenerator`` can generate one or more data frame columns (containing arbitrary data), and a model can be associated with any number of feature generators.\n",
    "     Several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "       * FeatureGenerators crititcally decouple the original raw data from the features used by the models, enabling different models to use different sets of features or \n",
    "         entirely different representations of the same features.\n",
    "       * FeatureGenerators become part of the model and are (where necessary) jointly trained with model. This facilitates model deployment, as every sensAI model becomes a single unit\n",
    "         that can directly process raw input data, which is (usually) straightforward to supply at inference time.\n",
    "       * FeatureGenerators store meta-data on the features they generate, enabling downstream components to handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The feature representation that we choose to generate can be arbitrary, but oftentimes, we will want to extract \"natural\" feature representations, which could, in priciple, be used by many types of models, albeit in different concrete forms.\n",
    "     Sequential data can be naturally represented as an array/list, categorical data can be represented using descriptive category names, and numeric data can be represented using \n",
    "     unmodified integers and floating point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Transforming feature representations into a form that is suitable for the model at hand** (using ``DataFrameTransformers``)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In the transformation stage, we address the model-specific idiosynchrasies, which may require, for example, that all features be represented as numbers (or even numbers within a limited range) or\n",
    "     that all features be discrete, that no values be missing, etc.\n",
    "     A ``DataFrameTransformer`` can, in principle perform an arbitary transformation from one data frame to another, but the typical use case is to apply transformations of feature representations that\n",
    "     are necessary for specific types of models to work (their best).\n",
