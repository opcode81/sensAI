Notice that in the above example, we had to hard-code the image dimension (``28``) as well as the number of classes (``10``), even though these parameters could have been easily determined from the data. Especially in other domains where feature engineering is possible, we might want to experiment with different combinations of features, and therefore automatically adapting to inputs is key if we want to avoid editing the model hyperparameters time and time again; similarly, we might change the set of target labels in our classification problem and the model should simply adapt to a changed output dimension.\n",
