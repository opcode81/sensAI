# Development Environment

This section explains the steps required to set up an environment in order to develop sensAI further.

## Clone Large Files

Clone the full repo, including large files using [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com):

    git lfs pull

This adds, in particular, data that is used in notebooks.

## Create the Python Virtual Environment

Use conda to set up the Python environment:

    conda env create -f environment.py

Solving the environment may take several minutes (but should ultimately work).

NOTE: versions are mostly unpinned in the environment specification, because this facilitates conda dependency resolution. Also, sensAI is intended to be compatible with *all* (newer) versions of the dependencies. If it isn't, we need to specify  an upper version bound in `setup.py` (where it matters the most) as well as in `environment.yml`. Compatibility with old (pinned) versions and the latest versions is tested in the tox build (see below).

# Build and Test Pipeline

The tests and docs build are executed via **tox** in several environments:
* `py`: the "regular" test environment, where we test against the pinned dependencies (by explicitly including `requirements.txt` with the pinned versions; this is also the environment in which we test the execution of notebooks
* `py_latest_dependencies`: the environment where we use the latest versions of all dependencies (except where we have identified an incompatibility; see `setup.py` definitions `DEPS_VERSION_LOWER_BOUND` and `DEPS_VERSION_UPPER_BOUND_EXCLUSIVE`); by not including `requirements.txt`, we depend on the latest admissible versions according to `setup.py`
* `docs`: the environment in which docs are built via sphinx 

## Automated Tests

The tests can be locally run without tox via

    sh run_pytest_tests.sh

## Docs Build

Docs are automatically created during the GitHub build via tox.

All .rst files are auto-generated (by `build_scripts/update_docs.py`), with the exception of the root index file  `index.rst`.

### Declaring Mock Imports for Dependencies

**Attention**: Make sure that any sensAI dependencies are added to `docs/_config.yml` under `autodoc_mock_imports`. 
Otherwise, the docs build will fail.

### Notebooks

`docs/index.rst` includes the names of notebooks which reside in the `notebooks/` folder. They are not initially present in the `docs/` folder, but any notebooks whose names are referenced in `index.rst` will be executed and saved with outputs to the `docs/` folder by a test in `notebooks/test_notebooks.py`.

Therefore, in order for the docs build to work (without temporarily removing the notebook inclusions), it is necessary to run the aforementioned test at least once via

    sh run_pytest_notebooks.sh

For changes in notebooks to be reflected in the docs build, the test needs to be rerun.

### Manually Running the Docs Build

The docs build can be run without tox via 

    sh build-docs.sh

Results will be stored in `docs/build/`.

# Creating a New Release

1. Switch to the `master` branch and merge any content the new release is to contain

2. Bump the version that the new release shall change by using one of the following commands:

   * `bumpversion patch --commit`
   * `bumpversion minor --commit`
   * `bumpversion major --commit`

   This will create a new beta version.
   
   If you intend to release a beta version, you may change the build number via `bumpversion build --commit`. 

3. Push this version to github
   `git push`
   and then check whether tests pass and the build succeeds.

4. If the build succeeded and you want to release this version, 

   * Set the release version and add the respective git tag:
     `bumpversion release --commit --tag`
     
     (unless you want to publish a beta version, in which case you need to skip this command and instead create the git tag manually.)

   * Push the new release:
     * `git push`
     * `git push --tags` (triggers PyPI release)

   If it did not succeed and you need to fix stuff, 

   * Fix whatever you need to fix, adding commits
   * Create a new test build via
     `bumpversion build --commit`
   * Continue with step 3.

# Source-Level Directory Sync

#### Details on the Synchonisation of a Source Directory within Your Project with the sensAI Repository

We support the synchronisation of a branch in the sensAI repository with a directory within the git repository of your project which is to contain the sensAI source code (i.e. alternative #2 from above) via a convenient scripting solution.

We consider two local repositories: the sensAI repository in directory `sensAI/` and your project in, for instance, directory `sensAI/../myprj/`. Let us assume that we want to synchronise branch `myprj-branch` in the sensAI repository with directory `myprj/src/sensai`.

##### Synchronisation Script

To perform the synchronisation, please create a script as follows, which you should save to `sensAI/sync.py`:

```python
import os
from repo_dir_sync import LibRepo, OtherRepo

r = LibRepo()
r.add(OtherRepo("myprj", "myprj-branch", os.path.join("..", "myprj", "src", "sensai")))
r.runMain()
```

You can add multiple other repositories if you so desire in the future.

From directory `sensAI/` you can use the script in order to 

* ***Push***: Update your project (i.e. `myprj/src/sensai`) with changes that were made in other projects by running `python sync.py myprj push`
* ***Pull***: Update `myprj-branch` in the sensAI repository with changes made in your project by running `python sync.py myprj pull`

##### Initialisation

To initialise the synchronisation, proceed as follows:

1. Create the branch `myprj-branch` in the sensAI repository, i.e. in `sensAI/` run this command:
   `git branch myprj-branch master`
2. Create the directory `myprj/src/sensai`.
3. Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file in `myprj/` with at least the following entries:

       *.pyc
       __pycache__
       *.bak
       *.orig

   Otherwise you may end up with unwanted tracked files after a synchronisation.
4. Perform the initial *push*, i.e. in `sensAI/` run this command:
   `python sync.py myprj push`

##### Things to Keep in Mind

* Both *push* and *pull* operations are always performed based on the branch that is currently checked out in `myprj/`. The best practice is to only use one branch for synchronisation, e.g. master.
* *Push* and *pull* operations will make git commits in both repositories. Should an operation ever go wrong/not do what you intended, use `git reset --hard` to go back to the commits before the operation in both repositories.
