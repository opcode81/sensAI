    "## VectorModel\n",
    "\n",
    "The backbone of supervised learning implementations is the `VectorModel` abstraction.\n",
    "It is so named, because, in computer science, a *vector* corresponds to an array of data,\n",
    "and vector models map such vectors to the desired outputs, i.e. regression targets or \n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this does *not* limit vector models to tabular data, because the data within\n",
    "a vector can take arbitrary forms (in contrast to vectors as they are defined in mathematics).\n",
    "Every element of an input vector could itself be arbitrary\n",
    "complex, and could, in the most general sense, be any kind of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The VectorModel Class Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "`VectorModel` is an abstract base class.\n",
    "From it, abstract base classes for classification (`VectorClassificationModel`) and regression (`VectorRegressionModel`) are derived. And we furthermore provide base classes for rule-based models, facilitating the implementation of models that do not require learning (`RuleBasedVectorClassificationModel`, `RuleBasedVectorRegressionModel`).\n",
    "\n",
    "These base classes are, in turn, specialised in order to provide direct access to model implementations based on widely used machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, etc.\n",

    "### DataFrame-Based Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector models use pandas DataFrames as the fundmental input and output data structures.\n",
    "Every row in a data frame corresponds to a vector of data, and an entire data frame can thus be viewed as a dataset or batch of data. Data frames are a good base representation for input data because\n",
    "  * they provide rudimentary meta-data in the form of column names, avoiding ambiguity.\n",
    "  * they can contain arbitrarily complex data, yet in the simplest of cases, they can directly be mapped to a data matrix (2D array) of features that simple models can directly process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fit` and `predict` methods of `VectorModel` take data frames as input, and the latter furthermore returns its predictions as a data frame.\n",
    "It is important to note that the DataFrame-based interface does not limit the scope of the models that can be applied, as one of the key principles of vector models is that they may define arbitrary model-specific transformations of the data originally contained in a data frame (e.g. a conversion from complex objects in data frames to one or more tensors for neural networks), as we shall see below.\n",

    "* are to be **modular**, meaning that a pipeline can be composed from reusable and user-definable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "An input pipeline typically serves the purpose of answering the following questions:\n",

    "* **How shall the data be pre-processed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  It might be necessary to process the data before we can use it and extract data from it.\n",
