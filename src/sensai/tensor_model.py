"""
This module contains base classes for models that input and output tensors, for examples CNNs.
The fitting and predictions will still be performed on data frames, like in VectorModel,
but now it will be expected that all entries of the input data frame passed to the model are tensors of the same shape.
Lists of scalars of the same lengths are also accepted. The same is expected of the ground truth data frames.
Everything will work as well if the entries are just scalars but in this case it is recommended to use
VectorModel instead.

If we denote the shapes of entries in the dfs as inputTensorShape and outputTensorShape,
the model will be fit on input tensors of shape (N_rows, N_inputColumns, inputTensorShape) and output tensors of
shape (N_rows, N_outputColumns, outputTensorShape), where empty dimensions (e.g. for one-column data frames)
will be stripped.
